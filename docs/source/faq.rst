How to contact us?
==================

You can contact us by joining the development and community channel on IRC:

* connect to the `libera.chat`__ network
* and join the ``#sopel`` channel

We talk about the bot's development, and we answer questions from bot owners &
plugin authors as much as we can. We try to keep it as friendly as possible;
sometimes we also just chat about about non-development topics.

All conversations are in English (except when someone swears in French).

.. _faq-bug-report:

How to report a bug?
====================

The best place to report a bug is to `open an issue on GitHub`__. We have
configured some templates to help and guide you through the process and
hopefully to make it easier for you.

Before submitting your bug, you can `search existing issues`__ to see if there
is one open already.

Do not hesitate to :ref:`contact us<faq-contact-us>` if you are unsure about
your bug report.
